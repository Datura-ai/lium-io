# The executor reserves every GPU (docker-compose.app.yml), so the NVIDIA container runtime hook
# runs when it starts. After a driver package update without a reboot that hook fails ("driver/library
# version mismatch") and a recreated executor never comes back: port 8080 stays closed and a rented
# node goes offline (12 Oct 2026, executor-v1.139). Before replacing a RUNNING executor, start a
# throwaway container from the image it already runs (local, nothing pulled) with every GPU requested
# and the entrypoint `true`, the same probe daturaai/lium-watchtower runs before it updates the runner.
# If that fails, keep the running executor and exit; the restart policy brings the runner back to try
# again; a probe that hangs past RUNNER_PROBE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS counts as failed. A first install (no executor
# running) has nothing to break and skips the probe.
